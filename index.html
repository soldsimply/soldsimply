				<h1><a name="whysoldsimply"></a>Why Choose SoldSimply?</h1>
				<p>eBay is a great service with over 100 million users worldwide, although it has its disadvantages. Users have to set up and eBay account, set up a PayPal account, create a listing with pictures, a description, and specifications of the item, have boxes to package the item, have packing material to insure a safe delivery of the product, and print and attach a shipping label. Most people want to get rid of old items and earning extra money, but selling their tablet, or their old camera is not worth the time nor effort.
SoldSimply has a minimum value price (the estimated cost an item has to exceed to be able to sell it) of <b>only $30!</b> Leading sellers have this price at $50! Most people donâ€™t have many items to sell that are worth over $50 but have many items around their house worth more than $30. SoldSimply only chaarges a <b>30% commission</b> rather than 35-40% that our competitors charge. We make it even easier for our clients by providing pickup of their items. SoldSimply is dedicated to providing <b>cheap,</b> <b>quality</b> service to their clients</p>
